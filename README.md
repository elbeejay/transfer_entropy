# Transfer Entropy

Implementation in python of transfer entropy statistic between two time series.  

Transfer entropy from X to Y, where X,Y are two random processes, is an asymmetric statistic measuring the reduction in uncertainty for a future value of X given the history of X and Y. Or the amount of information from Y to X. Calculated through the Kullback-Leibler divergence with conditional probabilities

Minor edits to code so it plays nice in Python3.7 (Aug. 2019 -Jay)
